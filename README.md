# Knowledge-distillation-in-LLMs-for-checkowrhty-statement-detection
This project uses two datasets for the task of check-worthy statement detection:
1. Political Debates Dataset (CT24 dataset)
Contains transcripts from political debates. Each statement is labeled based on its check-worthiness, helping to identify claims that may require fact-checking.

2. COVID-19 Tweets Dataset (CT22 dataset)
Consists of tweets related to COVID-19. This dataset also includes labels indicating whether a tweet is considered check-worthy.
